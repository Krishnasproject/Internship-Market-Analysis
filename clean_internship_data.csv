AI Agents - Social Media Automation,Sujith Kumar Gundala,Work from home,"AI Agents - Social Media Automation|Sujith Kumar Gundala|Actively hiring|Work from home|₹ 13,000 - 20,000 /month|4 Months|About us:  At S Combinator, we build AI-powered mobile and web applications across sports, education, and entertainment sectors. Our current focus is building a centralised AI agent that automates social media workflows. Think of it like a smart system that plans, designs and crafts content, creates posts and reels, schedules everything, and goes live on Instagram, X, and LinkedIn - from idea to post to publish- so humans can do human things  The mission (What you’ll do):  As an AI Agents Intern, you’ll help design and build AI-driven systems for social media automation- the first layer of a centralized AI agent platform.     1. Build a centralized AI agent orchestrating multiple brand-aware sub-agents (tone, voice, platform-specific behavior) 2. Create AI agents and sub-agents for social media content creation (Instagram, X, LinkedIn) 3. Automate the end-to-end content lifecycle: ideation → refinement → creation → scheduling → publishing 4. Generate platform-specific content (posts, captions, reels, short videos, graphics) 5. Build automated workflows that reduce manual effort and improve consistency 6. Integrate agents with APIs, schedulers, dashboards, and data sources  This is a hands-on engineering role focused on building real, production-oriented systems- not demos or toy projects.  Note:  1. Please don't apply if you don't have basic experience and curiosity in building AI Agents 2. Applications will be rejected if there is no prior experience  This role requires full ownership and independence. You’ll work with minimal guidance, take initiative, and be accountable for outcomes. We value a can-do attitude, curiosity, and the ability to move from idea to execution. You don’t need professional experience- but you must have built or experimented with AI systems, especially those involving automation or content generation.|JavaScript|Python|TypeScript|Cursor (GenAI)|3 weeks ago",https://internshala.com/internship/detail/work-from-home-ai-agents-social-media-automation-internship-at-sujith-kumar-gundala1768632297,data-science

This role is ideal for someone who has recently graduated (or is about to), is deeply curious about AI, and wants to apply it to real business problems, not just demos.  You’ll work closely with multiple teams to automate manual workflows, improve efficiency, and build lightweight AI-powered systems that save time and scale impact.  What You’ll Do - Identify repetitive or manual tasks across teams and design AI-driven solutions to automate them. - Experiment with and implement AI tools (LLMs, no-code/low-code tools, agents, APIs) to improve productivity. - Build simple internal tools, workflows, or scripts that reduce human effort. - Work with teams to understand problems, prototype solutions, and iterate quickly. Document workflows, automations, and learnings so others can use and scale them. - Stay updated with new AI tools, frameworks, and best practices and proactively suggest improvements.   Who You Are - Recently graduated or final-year student in any field (engineering background is a plus, but not mandatory). - Strong interest in AI tools and applied AI use-cases (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Zapier, Make, Notion AI, etc.). - Comfortable experimenting, breaking things, and figuring stuff out independently. - High ownership mindset — you don’t wait for perfect instructions. - Able to think in workflows and systems, not just one-off tasks. - Basic scripting or technical comfort (Python, JavaScript, APIs, spreadsheets, or automation tools) is a plus.  What We’re Looking For - Someone who can “play with AI” productively — test tools, connect systems, and ship usable solutions. - Practical mindset: “How can this save 5–10 hours a week for the team?” - Strong problem-solving and communication skills. - Willingness to learn fast and adapt in a high-ownership environment.
